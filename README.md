# 2nd-Order-Power-Losses-Estimation
The major problem of the power losses estimation arises when DG injects active power. As the injected active power (P) increases, the power losses estimation increases as well. Here the power loss is estimated using the second order Hessian Matrix for both active and reactive power losses.
